# deep_learning_based_ftc

This repository contains the proto-type for estimating the strength of authorship evidence or likelihood ratio with the deep-learning-based text representations.
The proto-type allows two methods for the score calculations: Cosine and Probablistic Linear Descriminant Analysis (PLDA). The proto-type is based on xxx, but largely extended to allow the PLDA method.
